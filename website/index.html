            <p class="sectionText" style="padding-top: 130px;">What a time to be alive. The time of a worldwide pandemic. In the context of COVID-19, physical and human resources in the healthcare system are at the center of the crisis. The soft lockdown in Switzerland specifically aimed to slow down
                the propagation of the virus and avoid an overwhelming situation in hospitals and clinics. There has been a tremendous effort to bring new beds in acute units, and medicine students as well as retired health practionners have been requisionned
                to help on different services.
                <br> <br> Whereas the current (2020 May 5th) numbers on the human and physical resources are unknown (or not open), we can find historical data and datasets from earlier this year (you know, when we were still hugging our loved ones and
                free to take a train without a mask). Below, the interactive <a href="#section1">map</a> allows to visualize the number of hospital beds and doctors per canton. Then, we’ll ask if there is any <a href="#section2">correlation</a> between
                canton’s wealth and number of resources (and thus, quality of care - if we simplify a bit). Finally, we’ll use a <a href="#section3">bipartite</a> illustration to show that woman practionners might currently be more impacted during the
                pandemic as they outnumber man practionners in the field of care.

            <h3> What is the gender repartition in healthcare practionners ? </h3>
            <p class="sectionText"> Between 1985 and 2005, 81% of women for only 19% of men obtained a diploma in healthcare. What is even more striking is the gender gap between high-paying jobs and less-paying jobs. Indeed, over ten years, 93% of woman studied to become caregivers,
                nurses and midwives, whereas only 38% received a diploma to become a dentist or a doctor. As salary equity is often used as an argument to show gender equality in an industry, the access to high-paying jobs should also be given for the
                sake of transparency; it still remains more difficult for women to access top-management postions and "prestigious " occupations. The following interactive dataviz entitles to show this disparity in healthcare.
