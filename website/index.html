                What were the numbers for physical and human resources in healthcare <i>before</i> COVID-19 ? One dataset from earlier this year (you know, when we were still able to hug our loved ones) and historical data are used in the following page
                to illustrate the numbers in Switzerland. First, the interactive
                <a href="#section1">map</a> allows to select the number of hospital beds and doctors per inhabitants for each canton. Then, we ask if the number of resources grow with the number of inhabitants and if the canton's <a href="#section2">wealth</a>                has any influence on the number of resources. Finally, a bipartite visualization is used to show the <i>unbalanced</i> <a href="#section3">gender</a> repartition and how woman practionners may currently be more impacted during the pandemic
                as they outnumber man practionners in average in the field of care.

            <h3> Does the number of resources grow with the number of inhabitants ?</h3>
            <p class="sectionText">One can imagine that the more inhabitants per canton, the more hospital beds and doctors. However, the correlation is not so clear. For instance, in the number of doctors, we observe a disparty between blue and red bubbles - where the reds
                represent the "rich" and the blues represent the cantons with a growth domestic product per capita equal or below the average. In this case, the red slope is steeper than the blue one and can be interpreted as a more significative increase
                of resources per inhabitants for the rich cantons.

                <br><br> For both resources, Zürich and Basel-Stadt appears as outliers. Basel-Stadt, one of the buisness center of Switzerland with less than 200’000 inhabitants, has the biggest growth domestic product per capita and the more resources.
                As this could be seen as a <i> "wealthy-logic" </i> correlation, it is interesing to see that its numbers are far above the other red cantons’s trend. Zürich on the other hand, with the biggest population in Switzerland, has a number of
                resources looking more similar to the blue trend despite its high growth domestic product per capita.

            <h3> What is the gender repartition in healthcare practionners ? </h3>
            <p class="sectionText"> Between 1985 and 2005, 81% of women for only 19% of men obtained a diploma in healthcare. What is even more striking is the gender gap between high-paying jobs and less-paying jobs. Indeed, over ten years, 93% of woman studied to become caregivers,
                nurses and midwives, whereas only 38% received a diploma to become a dentist or a doctor. As salary equity is often used as an argument to show gender equality in an industry, the access to high-paying jobs should also be given for the
                sake of transparency; it still remains more difficult for women to access top-management postions and "prestigious" occupations. The following interactive dataviz entitles to show this disparity in healthcare.

                <br>This dataset contains information per canton with indicators such as population density, growth domestic product per capita and health sector information such as the number of beds and the number of doctors per inhabitants. The number
                of beds per inhabitants corresponds to the total number of beds, including hospital beds, clinical beds and psychiatric beds.

                <br>The dataset spans over 20 years (1985-2005) which allows to analyse the trend over time. By plotting the male/female ratio for each category of jobs, we can see that the gender gap is going down over the years for doctors and dentists
                but does not change (or even get bigger) for the nurses, caregivers and midwives. What is also very interesting in this dataset is that all the categories contains two columns for male and female, except for the midwives. Is it really
                true that no man were practionners in this field before 2005 or it is just because the name of the function is gender-biased?
