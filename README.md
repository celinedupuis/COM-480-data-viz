## _Healthcare Resources in Switzerland_

In the middle of a worldwide pandemic, we wish we could take a step back from the stressful "new covid cases" and "number of death" by which we are constantly bombarded in the media at the moment. Interested in a more "neutral" way at a more "local" scale, I chose to explore the number of physical and human resources in the healthcare system in Switzerland. I use datasets from earlier this year as well as older data, enabling an analysis both before and during the crisis.

On top of the demographic analysis, I was willing to ask social justice questions such as "who is the more impacted during the pandemic ?”. However, one must be careful when extracting answers from data like number of doctors per inhabitants or amount of money made by each canton. Indeed, the data collection wasn’t necessarily meant to illustrate any repartition of privileges in the country at the first place. Seeking for this kind of answers may lead to over-interpretation. Hence, the interactive data visualizations that I developed in this project aim to illustrate some of the disparities by showing the numbers as they are, while asking open questions and providing an interactive tool for anyone to draw their own conclusions.
